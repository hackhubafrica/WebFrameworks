Next, run the Django command-line utilities to create the database tables automatically:
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
The makemigrations command looks at all your available models and creates migrations for whichever tables
donâ€™t already exist. migrate runs the migrations and creates tables in your database, as well as optionally providing
much richer schema control.
