#A common pattern is to use decorators to register functions as handlers for an event.

'''
Flaskâ€™s development web server supports a number of startup configuration options,
but the only way to specify them is by passing them as arguments to the app.run() call
in the script. This is not very convenient; the ideal way to pass configuration options is
through command-line arguments.

Flask-Script is an extension for Flask that adds a command-line parser to your Flask
application. It comes packaged with a set of general-purpose options and also supports
custom commands.
