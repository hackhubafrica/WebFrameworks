# MISSING-PERSONS-DATABASE-2024-KENYA-FINANCE-BILL-PROTESTS

## Overview

Welcome to the Missing Persons 2024 Antifinance Bill Demonstrations Kenya database. This AI-powered platform is designed to help track and identify individuals who have gone missing during the ongoing #RejectFinanceBill2024 protests. Our mission is to assist in reuniting families with their loved ones by providing a centralized and accessible online resource for all Kenyans.

## Goals

1. **Identify Abducted Individuals:** Aid in locating and identifying individuals abducted during the protests.
2. **Track Unidentified Bodies:** Keep a record of unidentified bodies found in various locations.
3. **Crowdsourced Information:** Allow the public to upload information about missing persons, including names, ages, photos, last known locations, and contact details.
4. **Monitor Disappearances:** Track disappearances across different demographics, including men, women, and children.

## Rationale

The number of missing persons reported since the start of the #RejectFinanceBill2024 protests has significantly increased. Families are in distress, not knowing the fate of their loved ones. By investigating all possible sites (dumpsites, quarries, rivers, lakes, wells, pit latrines, cremation sites) where bodies might be found, we aim to create a comprehensive and accurate database to track these cases. This platform will help us confirm who has been missing since day one and assist in reuniting them with their families.

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** An easy-to-navigate platform for uploading and searching information about missing persons.
2. **AI-Powered Search and Matching:** Advanced algorithms to efficiently match reports of missing persons with unidentified bodies and sightings.
3. **Real-Time Updates:** A live feed of updates and new reports to keep the database current.
4. **Secure and Confidential:** Protection of user data and handling of sensitive information with confidentiality.
5. **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed reports on missing persons to provide clarity and direction for investigations.
